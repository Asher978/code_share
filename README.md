## Description 
Code Share is a platform that provide Groups an ability to code together without being together in one place. The app has an option to work on coding challenges which include _TESTS_ or to work/share individual code collabratively. Users can also save the writen code in a JS format for their reference. The app provides a _CODE EDITOR_ sourced from another NPM PACKAGE _CODEMIRROR_. The app also provides a feature where USERS can find coding events based on the USER input language. USERS will also be able to create their own events. These events are viewable by all USERS. The app has a feature for _AUTHS_ thus enabling the USERS to create a unique profile.

## User Stories ( M V P )
  *  USER should be able to create a USER NAME ( NO AUTHS )
  *  USER should be able to view the coding challenges & the events on the main page
  *  USER should be able to select a challenge followed by a render of code editor for that challenge in a specific ROOM
  *  USER should be able to SAVE the code by an option of DOWNLOAD
  *  USER should be abe to view who is in the ROOM and who is typing should show
  *  USER should be able to CREATE or SEARCH coding events based on the language they provided

## BONUS FEATURES (All Accomplished)
  - [x] AUTHS - option to REGISTER and LOGIN
  - [x] CHAT window in the ROOMS 
  - [x] Providing tests for the code challenges 

## Our Approach
We utilized React.js for the UI. Socket.io was utilized on both sides the front and back end in order to keep sync with the server and the user. All of our API calls are being inititated from the server side to protect the API Keys. Code writen by users is being sent to the server via POST request and is being executed in a sandbox _ENV_. We utilized the CRUD functionality by giving the users an option to create their own events that are viewable to all users.

## Installation Instructions
  *  Yarn install from the _MAIN PROJECT FOLDER & THE CLIENT FOLDER_ to install all dependencies
  *  Few Changes need to happen before you start servers:
    *  In _Client/src/components_ two files need an update. (SingleChallenge.jsx & CodeEditor.jsx) Please make the following change to line # 26 in both files.  

    ```
    const socket = io.connect();

    // change to 

    const socket = io.connect('http://localhost:3001');

    // save and run servers after this change
    
    ```

## Road Blocks

![RoadBlocks](http://apps.frontline.org/police-stops/img/indianapolis.gif)

  *  Getting the tests to work in the _SANDBOX ENV_ especially having 4 different NPM Packages work together
  *  Sockets.io to update and reflect the changes once a new USER joins the room
  *  Redirecting to HOME page after a USER logs in

## Loose Ends
  *  When a new EVENT is created by a USER, the change should reflect without refreshing the page
  *  Integrating Mocha Tests for the challenges
